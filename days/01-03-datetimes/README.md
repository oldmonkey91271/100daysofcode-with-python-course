# Days 01-03 Dealing with Datetimes

Datetimes. The bane of our existence as coders (or at least for me anyway!).

This set of lessons will walk you through the basics of datetime, starting with datetime and date then moving onto timedelta.


## Day N: Learn the basics of datetime and date

A super basic day to get you started. Watch *Learning datetime and date* and *Calculating time with datetime timedelta*.

After watching the videos, use your Python shell to play around with some timestamp calculations as per the content in the videos.


## Day N+1: Parsing dates from logs Bite exercise

Head on over to [Pybites Platforms](https://pybitesplatform.com/) and sign up if you haven't already.

Work on [Parsing dates from logs](https://pybitesplatform.com/bites/parsing-dates-from-logs/) for your second day of learning datetime.

Edit: We decided to simplify the original Bite exercise slightly after some feedback we received from students. We've now removed the requirement to read in the file which should keep the Bite focused on the theme.

Additionally, we've added another TWO free Bites that should be more appropriate for beginners. Unlock them here: [Working with datetimes](https://pybitesplatform.com/bites/working-with-datetimes/) and [Work with datetime's strptime and strftime](https://pybitesplatform.com/bites/work-with-datetimes-strptime-and-strftime/).


## Day N+2: Your Turn!

You've got the basics down so now create something for yourself!

A fun project would be to create yourself a Pomodoro Timer that incorporates datetime rather than just the time module. Have it display timestamps.

This could also be applied to a stopwatch app. Use time of course but also throw in the timestamps and even some basic calculations on the difference between the start and end timestamps.

We encourage you to _pull request_ your work via [PyBites Code Challenge #52](https://pybit.es/articles/codechallenge52/). Have fun!

### Time to share what you've accomplished!
